* Kashmir

A rag-tag grab bag of useful generic Haskell code. [[https://github.com/krisajenkins/kashmir/find/master][Contents]]. Published
for my benefit, but feel free to use it if you wish.

** Why Kashmir?

I was playing around with the letters from 'Kris' and 'Haskell' and listening to
Led Zeppelin.
